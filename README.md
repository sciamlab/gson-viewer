SciamLab GeoJson Viewer

Intro
-----------------------
The aim of the project is to define a simple service to render on map the content of a URI returning data in [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/) format.

How to use
--------
The tool simply takes as input an URI as ```uri``` query parameter and shows the returned data on the map.

Using [this](https://gist.github.com/pstarace/01bb1a568619b171d7ae#file-rome-geojson) gist as example:
[http://github.sciamlab.com/gson-viewer?uri=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pstarace/01bb1a568619b171d7ae/raw/74c28fa998872bebfe8e5b5915f0c4d4d779595c/rome.geojson](http://github.sciamlab.com/gson-viewer?uri=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pstarace/01bb1a568619b171d7ae/raw/74c28fa998872bebfe8e5b5915f0c4d4d779595c/rome.geojson)

If a wrong uri is passed or the uri doesn't return a valid GeoJson, a world map is shown:
[http://github.sciamlab.com/gson-viewer?uri=xxx.gson](http://github.sciamlab.com/gson-viewer?uri=xxx.gson)

If you need to pass any other query parameters to the GeoJson endpoint, simply add them to the query string and they will be passed to the url.

Contribute
----------
The tool is pretty stable as it has been extensivelly tested. If you spot any issue please report on [ideas and bugs](https://github.com/sciamlab/gson-viewer/issues).
